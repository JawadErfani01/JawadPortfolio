          Hello! I am Javad from Afghanistan. I am a student of Herat
          University, Faculty of Computer Science, Department of Software
          Engineering And I'm a self-taught developer who loves to challenge and
          find solutions building efficient projects both for clients and to
          enhance my skillset. I started my web development journey after
          succeeding in college in 2019. By understanding the potential and
          opportunities for growth. Later, while Gradually increasing my skills,
          I gained my passion in this field. Web application Development is
          something I always wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p className="xl:py-8 py-4">
          I'm a kind of person who doesn't stop unless explore something.
          Therefore, I keep exploring multiple methods of building web
          applications. Now, I feel more confident to build full scale
          applications and to solve business problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out my projects on GitHub and I mostly share about my progress
          and web development tips and resoruces on Twitter. I'm also available
          to hire for your projects. Feel free to contact me.
