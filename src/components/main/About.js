          Hello! I'm Jawad from Afghanistan. I'm a self taught developer,
          building efficient projects both for clients and to enhance my
          skillset. I started my web development journey after pandemic in 2020
          by realizing the potential & growth opportunities. Later, while
          gradually enhancing my skills, I got my passion in this field. Web app
          development is something that I always wanted to do.
        </p> 
        <p className="py-8">I'm a kind of person who doesn't stop unless explore something. Therefore, I keep exploring multiple methods of building web applications. Now, I feel more confident to build full scale applications and to solve business problems.</p>
      <p >Check out my projects on GitHub and I mostly share about my progress and web development tips and resoruces on Twitter. I'm also available to hire for your projects. Feel free to contact me.</p>
