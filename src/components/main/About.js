          Hello! I am Jawad from Afghanistan. I graduated from Herat University,
          where I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Software
          Engineering Department. I am also a self-taught developer who loves a
          challenge and finding solutions to build efficient projects for
          clients and enhance my skill set. I began my web development journey
          in 2019 after succeeding in college and realizing the potential
          opportunities for growth. Gradually increasing my skills, I developed
          a passion for this field, specifically web application development,
          which is something I have always wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p className="xl:py-8 py-4">
          I am the kind of person who doesn't stop exploring unless I have
          thoroughly investigated something. Therefore, I continually explore
          multiple methods of building web applications. Now, I feel more
          confident in building full-scale applications and solving business
          problems.
        </p>

          Check out my projects on GitHub. I mostly share my progress, web
          development tips, and resources on Twitter. Additionally, I am
          available for hire for your projects. Feel free to contact me.
